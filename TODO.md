- `curses` now works! Things to do specifically to fix things:

  - "titlebar" colors need to be fixed (blue on white and bold)

  - show all values in window

  - "controlbar" colors need to be fixed (only keys in color)

  - catch key input properly

- include Bar in output display (for voltage and current)

- handle user input
